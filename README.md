Hi Yash,

I wanted to update you on our progress. We’ve encountered some issues after the merge, along with a few challenges in Suchita's part of the code from before the merge. I’ll provide more details in tomorrow’s meeting. I understand the importance of staying on schedule, so I’ll be working over the weekend to ensure we catch up in the next 2-3 days.

Thank you for your understanding.
